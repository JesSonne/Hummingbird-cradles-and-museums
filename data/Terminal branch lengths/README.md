# Files of species terminal branch lengths using different approaches to adding missing species to the phylogeny


**TBL_random:** Matrix listing terminal branch length of endemic species (25% range size quartile) over 1000 permutations; missing species in the phylogeny were added based on a random sample from all R-values.  


**TBL_early:** Matrix listing terminal branch length of endemic species (25% range size quartile) over 1000 permutations; missing species in the phylogeny were added based on a randomly sampled R-value following an 'early burst model'.  


**TBL_late:** Matrix listing terminal branch length of endemic species (25% range size quartile) over 1000 permutations; missing species in the phylogeny were added based on a randomly sampled R-value following an 'late burst model'.  

**TBL_33_random:** Matrix listing terminal branch length of endemic species (33% range size quartile); missing species in the phylogeny were added based on a random sample from all R-values.
